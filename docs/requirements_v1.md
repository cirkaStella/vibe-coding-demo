# Product Requirements Document: Mushroom Spotter App (v1)

## Overview
The Mushroom Spotter App is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help users remember and record mushroom spots while exploring forests. The app leverages OpenStreetMap for mapping and is optimized for offline use, ensuring usability even in remote areas. The design is warm and organic, encouraging users to embrace nature and enjoy mushroom hunting adventures.

## Features

### 1. Mushroom Spot Recording
- Users can mark and save locations ("mushroom spots") on a map while out in the forest.
- Each spot can be dropped as a pin on the map with a simple tap or long-press gesture.
- Before saving a new pin, the user must confirm the action (e.g., via a dialog or prompt).
- Users can add, edit, or delete descriptions for each pin.
- Users can delete pins from the map.
- Users can add optional notes or photos to each spot (future versions may expand on this).

### 2. Interactive OpenStreetMap Integration
- The app displays an interactive OpenStreetMap as the main interface.
- Users can freely pan and zoom the map.
- Pins are visually distinct and easy to place and view.

### 3. Offline Map Availability
- The map and saved pins must be accessible without an internet connection.
- Map tiles and user data are cached for offline use.
- The app should gracefully handle transitions between online and offline states.

### 4. Mobile-First Design
- The user interface is optimized for mobile devices (responsive layout, touch-friendly controls).
- The app is installable as a PWA and works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

### 5. Warm, Organic Visual Design
- The design uses a warm, earthy color palette and organic shapes.
- Visual elements evoke the feeling of being in nature, encouraging users to put on rubber boots and go mushroom hunting.
- Typography and iconography are chosen to reinforce the friendly, outdoorsy theme.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The app must load quickly and work reliably in low-connectivity environments.
- User data (pins, notes) is stored locally on the device for privacy and offline access.
- The app should be easy to use, with minimal onboarding required.

## Out of Scope (v1)
- User authentication or cloud sync.
- Social sharing or collaboration features.
- Advanced mushroom identification or AI features.
